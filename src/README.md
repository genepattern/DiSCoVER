A backup of DiSCoVER's code (as used by this module) and the supporting files can be foudnd here: https://datasets.genepattern.org/?prefix=data/module_support_files/DiSCoVER/

In a future version of this module, the code will be decoupled from the (large) support files and backed up via GitHub. But in order to preserve reproducibility, this version is baked up together.
